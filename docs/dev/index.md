# Extending

If you want to extend Docable, there are two main avenues you can take.

## Themes

You can check out other examples to get inspiration. Themes are developed
using React and RCSS, and *everything is javascript*. It actually works super
well.

## Plugins

Plugins can do a number of things, including:

- create "derived pages" -- pages that summerize or otherwise are based off of
  other pages. An "index" or "blog summary" page is an example of such a page.
- reorganize / modify / remove pages

# Contributing

If you actually want to hack on docable, the [lifecycle](/dev/lifecycle.html) page will give you a good idea of how things work. The actual generation itself is only [some] hundred lines of well-documented code, so it should be fairly approachable. Let me know what you want done!
