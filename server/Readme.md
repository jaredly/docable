Most basic use case is the Readme.md. Beyond that is extra.

So something akin to prose.io....

But then you can also edit files.
... but why not by the original paths? I think that makes much more sense than
displaying the eventual rendered paths. Yeah.
An editor edits things according to the position on the filesystem.

Ok, so we just need to gather up files.

- file paths
- preprocess files
- generate additional files (skip this one for now)
- render files
- postprocess files (?)
- write things out...
