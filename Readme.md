## Docable is here to make documentation easy and enjoyable

- open source
- flexible
- optimized for usability

# Features

## IDE is built in
This is really the reason I built docable. I wanted a rich experience for creating documentation, and none of the existing systems quite lent themselves to what I wanted.

With the Integrated Documentation Environment, writing docs is not only palatable, but downright appealing.

## Just markdown
Markdown is awesome. WhatYouWriteIsWhatYouWant. Or something.

Plus there are some bonuses for unlocking a bit more visual flexibility. Look at the [Writing](/writing.html) page for full details.

## Plugin based
What can plugins do?
- add page-level blocks
- generate derivative pages
- modify the nav items

## Awesome defaults
The base theme uses material design coloring and beautiful, readable fonts.
